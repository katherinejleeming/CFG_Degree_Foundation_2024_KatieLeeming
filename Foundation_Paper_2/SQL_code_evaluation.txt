SELECT
    patient_id, COUNT(*) AS admission_count
FROM 
    admissions
JOIN
    departments ON admissions.department_id = departments.department_id
WHERE
    (departments.department_name = 'Cardiology' OR departments.department_name IS NULL)
    AND admission_date >= '2015-01-01'
GROUP BY
    patient_id
ORDER BY
    admission_count DESC
LIMIT 1;

Improvements to code:
1. use IS NULL rather than = NULL in SQL queries
2. Use a JOIN rather than a subquery
3.
